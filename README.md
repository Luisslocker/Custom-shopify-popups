# 🧩 Custom Shopify Popups – Luis’s Locker

This repo documents how we built a custom, conversion-ready Shopify popup for [Luis’s Locker](https://luisslocker.com) — bypassing limitations and getting it live without any paid apps or third-party newsletter forms.

---

## ✅ What We Did

- Removed the default Shopify newsletter section
- Implemented a custom email capture popup using Liquid + CSS
- Made it mobile-friendly and visually aligned with the brand
- Bypassed the need for Klaviyo or paid plugins

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters

Shopify limits free themes from fully controlling popup behavior. By customizing the popup directly and skipping the newsletter footer, we:
- Improved visibility
- Increased signup rate
- Maintained full design control
